Hacktoberfest is the easiest way to get into open source! Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open-source code presented by Digital Ocean.

During the entire month of October 2023, all you have to do is contribute to any open-source project with the hacktoberfest tag and open at least 4 pull requests which follow the [Hacktoberfest guidelines](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/faq). It can be any project mentioned below and you can contribute in any way possible. It can be a bug fix, optimisation, feature addition or even a documentation enhancement!
